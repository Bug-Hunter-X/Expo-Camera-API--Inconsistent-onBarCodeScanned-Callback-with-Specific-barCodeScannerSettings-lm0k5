This bug occurs when using the Expo `Camera` API with certain configurations.  Specifically, when using the `onBarCodeScanned` prop and setting `barCodeScannerSettings` to specific values, the callback may not be triggered consistently or at all. This is particularly noticeable with certain barcode types or when scanning barcodes at various distances or angles. The error might manifest as a lack of response or unexpected behavior within the `onBarCodeScanned` function.

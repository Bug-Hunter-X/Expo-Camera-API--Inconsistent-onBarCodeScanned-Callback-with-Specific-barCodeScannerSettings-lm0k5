While a complete fix requires deeper investigation into Expo's Camera API and underlying libraries, several workarounds can improve reliability:

1. **Increase Scanning Tolerance:** Adjust `barCodeScannerSettings` to increase tolerance for barcode detection. Experiment with parameters like `barCodeTypes`, scanning frequency, or detection thresholds.
2. **Multiple Scan Attempts:** Implement logic to retry scanning after a timeout if no barcode is detected within a reasonable timeframe. This can handle temporary glitches or low-quality scans.
3. **Alternative Barcode Scanner Libraries:** Consider integrating a different barcode scanning library outside of Expo's `Camera` API, such as a native module. This may offer improved performance and reliability.

**Example (bugSolution.js):**

```javascript
import * as React from 'react';
import { Camera, BarCodeScanner } from 'expo-camera';

function App() {
  const [scanned, setScanned] = React.useState(false);
  const handleBarCodeScanned = ({ type, data }) => {
    setScanned(true);
    // Add retry logic here if needed
    console.log('Barcode data:', data);
  };

  return (
    <Camera style={{ flex: 1 }} onBarCodeScanned={handleBarCodeScanned} barCodeScannerSettings={{
      //Adjust parameters for improved scanning tolerance
      barCodeTypes: [BarCodeScanner.Constants.BarCodeType.qr],
    }}>
       {/* ... rest of your app UI ... */}
    </Camera>
  );
}
export default App;
```
